## partroxis
Galaban's Partroxis Plugin

This plugin provides "guides" through the Partroxis maze.  When you enter a
room in the maze, the guide will provide the correct direction.  If multiple
directions exist, the guide will show you the two possibilities.  If you choose
wrong, the next time you enter the room, that exit will not be shown.

There is also a speedwalk function that will return you to the last correct
room in the maze:  "partroxis return"

BY DEFAULT, these guides are not enabled. You will not receive any help.
Re-enter the area or use "partroxis guide" to turn the guides on.

Commands available:
* partroxis help           -- this help screen
* partroxis guide          -- Enable/Disable the maze guides
* partroxis return         -- return to the last explored room in the maze
* partroxis reset          -- reset the internal cache
* partroxis off            -- A blank "off" button
